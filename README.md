## Coding Problems

This repo contains a hodge-podge of coding problems and solutions and an analysis of problem solving approaches.

Most of this code I'm writing on paper, then typing up to execute and test here. It's a storage place for me to work through coding processes.

Mostly written in JavaScript with some C#.

Do whatever you want with it.

# Homework 2

[15 points] Modify the bubble sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void bubbleReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the selection sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void selectionReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the merge sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. . Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void mergeReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the quick sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. . Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.    Call it:  static void quickReverseSort(string[] arr)

[40 points] In Main read the entries given in the file input.txt (one line per entry) and store them into an array. Make four copies of it. Then, on each copy call bubbleReverseSort, selectionReverseSort, mergeReverseSort, quickReverseSort. For each of these measure the execution time (how long it took to run the reverse sorting) and display this time. Hint for measuring execution (see the class notes!)

What is a linear search?

a sorted array with all elements appear twice except one, find that element (the best solution
should be O(logn)) 

Find out whether a substring occurs in a given string?

If you had 100 floors and 2 eggs, what is the most efficient way to determine what floor is the
maximum height you can drop an egg and not crack it?

do not use an extra array ... the second array should be sufficient
i.e. your algorithm should use O(1) extra space.

#Homework 2

[15 points] Modify the bubble sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void bubbleReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the selection sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void selectionReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the merge sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. . Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.   Call it:  static void mergeReverseSort(string[] arr)

[15 points] Modify the quick sort algorithm seen in class so it works with an array of strings AND the array will have the values sorted in reverse. . Also add a local variable count (use long count) of the number of comparisons that were performed. Display it before exiting this method.    Call it:  static void quickReverseSort(string[] arr)

[40 points] In Main read the entries given in the file input.txt (one line per entry) and store them into an array. Make four copies of it. Then, on each copy call bubbleReverseSort, selectionReverseSort, mergeReverseSort, quickReverseSort. For each of these measure the execution time (how long it took to run the reverse sorting) and display this time. Hint for measuring execution (see the class notes!)
